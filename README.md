A very simple, minimal PHP framework.

This is what I build my PHP applications on. It is on GitHub:

 - To establish copyright for legal purposes.
 - In case someone else might find it useful.

I tend to hack this quite a bit to suit whatever project I am working on,
so there is no guarantee that it won't be broken quite often.
